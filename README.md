A finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog is a powerful method for designing digital systems that transition between different states based on inputs and clock cycles. Verilog, a hardware description language, allows for the implementation of FSMs by defining states, transitions, and outputs using always blocks and case statements. FSMs can be categorized into two types: **Moore machines**, where outputs depend solely on states, and **Mealy machines**, where outputs depend on both states and inputs. By leveraging Verilog's constructs, engineers can create efficient, scalable, and maintainable digital designs that are crucial for various applications, from simple control systems to complex integrated circuits.
